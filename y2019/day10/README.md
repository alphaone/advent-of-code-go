# Lessons learnt

It was interesting to learn how to calculate the angle between two vectors. I
had to use the `atan2` function from the `math` module. Sorting vectors
clockwise (or counter-clockwise) was challenging.

I am still puzzled how the check for proportional vectors works (`a.X*b.Y == b.Y*b.X`).
